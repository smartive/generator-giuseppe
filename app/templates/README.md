## How to dev

The following npm scripts are installed in the package.json file:

- `clean`: deletes the coverage and build folder
- `build`: compiles the application and removes unnecessary things
- `develop`: runs the compiler in watching mode for continuous development
- `lint`: runs the linter over the files
- `start`: runs the compiled application (intended for running the final app)
- `test`: runs the linter and afterwards the tests
- `test:watch`: runs the tests in watch mode for continuous development & testing (does compile the code by itself)
