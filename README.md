## How to use

TL;DR:
```bash
npm install -g yo generator-giuseppe typings && yo giuseppe
```

Of course, you need `yeoman`. So if you don't already have installed yeoman, install it with:
```bash
npm install -g yo
```

After that, you need this generator. Install it in the global context as well:
```bash
npm install -g generator-giuseppe
```

This generator installs all the npm packages and typings needed for an up and running `giuseppe`
application. So another global dependency is `typings`.
```bash
npm install -g typings
```

After those steps, you can run yeoman with the giuseppe generator:
```bash
yo giuseppe
```

All the essential questions are answered and the corresponding project is generated for you.
So in that sense:

Happy coding with [giuseppe](https://github.com/smartive/giuseppe) :smile:
